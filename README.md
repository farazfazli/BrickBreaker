# BrickWave
Brick Breaker style game created with Unity.

Made as part of Ben's [Unity Course] (https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/).

# Motivation
I wanted to learn more about the Unity Game Engine and C#, so I created this game over the weekend following an excellent Unity course on Udemy.

# Assets
Paddle and brick sprites are created with GIMP and are free to use under the MIT license. Backgrounds are free to "reuse with modification".
